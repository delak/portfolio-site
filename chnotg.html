question: How can we help Community Health Nurses do a better job?
categories: UI Design
description: <p>A mobile app designed to give Community Health Nurses within the Ghana Health Service — focused on maternal, newborn and child health outcomes in rural areas — valuable information, training and motivation. Even though research, content and an initial UI had already been developed, the Grameen Foundation asked me to come up with a new User Interface that was more usable and attractive.</p>

        The existing design made it difficult for users to tell how deep they were within the app's content structure. I identified four discrete levels of information that users could navigate to, and normalized all of the content, layout and navigation to fit this structure across all screens.

      <div class="info-pane-content">
        In addition to providing a menu structure that was clearer and more hierarchical, I also implemented a way for users to discover useful information while using the app.

        As a way of simplifying user flows, certain pieces of information were re-deployed as modal windows instead of entirely new pages. This allowed users to access certain information without having to leave a particular screen.
