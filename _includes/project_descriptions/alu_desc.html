<p>MiViewTV is an IPTV application for Alcatel-Lucent that I was asked to redesign as part of the team at <a href="http://www.experientia.com/" target="_blank">Experientia</a>.</p>
<p>My role was in the development of concepts that fit the UI design language already established through Alcatel-Lucent's identity guidelines and existing mobile apps, followed by the Interaction Design of the screens according to the Information Architecture that had been defined, and finally in the development of the prototype with FlashÂ®.</p>
