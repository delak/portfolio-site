      The existing design made it difficult for users to tell how deep they were within the app's content structure. I identified four discrete levels of information that users could navigate to, and normalized all of the content, layout and navigation to fit this structure across all screens.

      In addition to providing a menu structure that was clearer and more hierarchical, I also implemented a way for users to discover useful information while using the app.

      As a way of simplifying user flows, certain pieces of information were re-deployed as modal windows instead of entirely new pages. This allowed users to access certain information without having to leave a particular screen.
