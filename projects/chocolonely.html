question: <strong>Empowering</strong><br> cocoa farmers with Design Thinking
intro:
  <p>How can Design Thinking be used to empower people living in rural coca-farming communities? This is the question that the <strong>Chocolonely Foundation</strong> asked of us at The Cobalt Partners. In response we developed and implemented a program (dubbed the <strong>&lsquo;Designathon&rsquo;</strong>) focused on equipping participants with skills that they can use to identify and address insights in their community.</p>
  <p>Participants were taken through a series of modules containing <mark>proverbs, anecdotes and challenges</mark> that taught Design Thinking fundamentals in easy to understand ways. They also undertook a number of projects to address various opportunities that we (or they) had identified, ranging from transporting water from the borehole more efficiently to drying cocoa beans in 3 days instead of 6.
  <p>We also <mark>defined 8 core skills and outcomes</mark> which we used to structure the curriculum and measure success. In all, over 30 participants were trained.</p>
