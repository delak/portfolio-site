question: <strong>Empowering</strong> cocoa farmers with Design Thinking
intro:
  <p>How can Design Thinking be used to empower people living in rural coca-farming communities? This is the question that the <strong>Chocolonely Foundation</strong> asked of us at The Cobalt Partners. In response we developed and implemented a program (dubbed  <strong>&lsquo;Designathon&rsquo;</strong>) focused on equipping participants with skills that they can use to identify and address insights in their community.</p>
  <p>By taking inspiration from various sources (including Jobs-To-Be-Done theory) and focusing on visual communication and hands-on making, participants were taken through a series of modules containing <mark>proverbs, anecdotes and challenges</mark> that taught Design Thinking fundamentals in a very non-traditional way. They undertook a number of projects to address various opportunities, ranging from how to transport water to their homes more efficiently to how to dry cocoa beans in 3 days instead of 6. We also defined (and refined) a framework for structuring the program and measuring success consisting of <mark>8 core skills and outcomes</mark>, including Curiosity, Stick-to-it-iveness and Maker Mindset.
  <p>In all, over 30 participants were trained.</p>
