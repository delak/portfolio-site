question: <strong>Communicating</strong><br> the future of the creative office
intro:
  <p><strong>beta unopuntozero</strong> is an office furniture system, designed specifically for creative offices by Pierandrei Associati.</p>
  <p>The success of the communication was very much contigent upon <mark>lockstep integration with the philosophy behind the design</mark> of the product itself, evident in its nature-inspired organic forms, implementation as a sustainable Product-Service System and its embrace of the creative office lifestyle.</p>
  <p>We defined a comprehensive strategy in which we <mark>defined target users, design language, and a brand evolution</mark> for the client company, Tecno. This also included a set of design principles derived from the extensive research and product design work already done by the team, and functioned as a design brief under which we could streamline all design across the beta system, which (aside from the product itself) included catalogs, advertising, technical documentation and website.</p>
  <p>A <mark>270-page concept book</mark> expounding on beta as a philosophy and Pierandrei Associati's design process, from conceptualization to research to implementation. It was used as a sales and marketing tool, and as an accompaniment to the product itself.</p>
  <p>beta won a Red Dot Design Award and a GOOD Design Award.</p>
