question: <strong>Product strategy &amp; capacity building</strong><br> at a fintech startup
intro:
  <p>This project for an Accra-based <strong>fintech startup</strong> was dual-purpose. The first objective was to clarify and redefine the value proposition and communication strategies behind their product. The second was to build the UX capacity of the team.</p>
  <p>Through a series of week-long research and design sprints, I led the team to interview potential customers, synthesize archetypes, define frameworks for prioritizing value propositions and feature sets, facilitate internal ideation sessions, test concepts as well as brand and communication strategies and perform usability tests. This led to a prototype of a new Minimum Viable Product that embodied a  strategic recommendation for the team to build upon as well as several other recommendations.</p>
  <p>Simultaneously, I trained and mentored the team — who worked closely with me throughout the process — to effectively conduct and synthesize interviews and usability tests in support of their own design and development process moving forward.</p>
