question: <strong>Capacity building &amp; product strategy</strong><br> at a fintech startup
intro:
  <p>I assisted a <strong>financial technology startup</strong> to clarify and redefine the value proposition of their product, and helped design a Minimum Viable Product that embodied a new strategic recommendation for the team to build upon.</p>
  <p>Through a series of week-long research and design sprints, I helped to interview potential customers, synthesize archetypes and potential value propositions for each, facilitate internal ideation sessions, test concepts as well as brand and communication strategies and perform usability tests.</p>
  <p>Simultaneously, the process served as a training and mentoring exercise for the team, who are now able to effectively conduct and synthesize interviews and usability tests in support of their own design and development process moving forward.</p>
