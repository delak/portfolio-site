question: <strong>Improving</strong><br> micro-loan applications<br>for low-literate users
description: <p>Fido is a micro-loan company based in Ghana whose model is based on accepting and processing loan requests through their own mobile application. We were asked to help increase the speed and completion rate of the process by improving usability. Of paramount concern was how Fido's customers — often low-literate and unfamiliar with smartphones — might be able to use the app with minimal intervention.</p>

      Reviewing and correcting errors proved to be major pain points. We broke the form into logical chunks and provided a review panel to allow users to review and correct their entries before proceeding to the next screen. Errors were clearly marked, and hyperlinked back to the relevant field to make it easier for users to find and correct it.

      Our interventions were both semantic — in the wording of the questions — and in the interaction design. For example, users had difficulty using dropdown menus which for gave little usability cues and hid the possible responses. They were replaced with radio button lists, which displayed the options upfront.

      Users who were not used to interacting with smartphones, rarely knew how to get the cursor to move to the next field whenever they were done filling one field. “Next” made it easier for them to do that. Users who were used to using a smartphone tended to conveniently ignore the “Next” button and scroll normally.

        We watched new and old Fido users interact with the existing app to identify pain points and re-map the user flows. Usability tests were also conducted at each phase of design.

        Our process relied heavily on quickly generating and testing concepts with potential users. Early designs were tested using paper and cardboard prototypes to extrapolate an appropriate design direction.
